# MVVM_Architecture
Model View ViewModel design pattern in java
In this Model class created, MainActivity is a View and AppViewModel class created which is ViewModel.
Model class simply holds variables, gettters, setters etc.
AppViewModel class helds the execution of onCLick event, getting data from model and storing it.
XML file includes data variable which gets the viewmodel stored values and bind that values to component.
